Please create a folder for each extension.

Each folder should have a readme file, explaining
- the goal of the extension
- the list of tasks, from simple to complex
- the source code

Each folder should have a subfolder template, which includes only the barebone of the files and hints about how to accomplish the tasks in comments.
